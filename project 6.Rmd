I couldn't get my pdf to work properly, and I needed to ask for help on this project.
1.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
sort(table(myDF3$V10))
```
Top 5: California, New York, Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania
myDF3$V10 is the file that the contribution by state is being pulled from. the sort function is supposed to file the data into a table in numerical order

2.
~/by_date $ cat donation.txt | awk -F \| '{print $10}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
awk is supposed to print the values from file 10 out, and sort uniq -c and sort -n is supposed to sort the values into unique groups and numerical order
3.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
sort(tapply(myDF3$V15, myDF3$V10, sum, na.rm=T))
```
Top 5: California, New York, Texas, Florida, DC
sort sorts the values into numerical order, and tapply organizes data and operates a sum funciton on the data groups
