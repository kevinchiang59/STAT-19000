1. Use the airline data stored in this directory:

/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009

1a. What was the average arrival delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?

Command used:
chiang59@scholar-fe04:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat 2005.csv | awk -F, '{arrdelay += $15; numFlights +=1 } END{print arrdelay/numFlights}'
This command takes the arrival delays in 2005 and averages it out in minutes

Result:
7.03274

1b. What was the average departure delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?

Command used:
chiang59@scholar-fe04:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat 2005.csv | awk -F, '{arrdelay += $16; numFlights +=1 } END{print arrdelay/numFlights}'
This command is almost the same as 1a, but uses $16 to find departure delay

Result:
8.51186

1cd. Now revise your solution to 1ab, to account for the full set of data, across all years.

1c.
Command used:
chiang59@scholar-fe04:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $  cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{arrdelay += $15; numFlights +=1 } END{print arrdelay/numFlights}'
This command is the same as 1a, but I am pulling data from all years (1987-2000) instead of just 2005

Result:
6.9023

1d.
Command used: 
chiang59@scholar-fe04:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $  cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{arrdelay += $15; numFlights +=1 } END{print arrdelay/numFlights}'
The command is the same as 1b, but the data is pulled from all years also

Result:
8.01844

2. Revise your solutions to 1abcd to only include flights that took place on the weekends.

2a.
Command used:
chiang59@scholar-fe04:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat 2005.csv | awk -F, '{if($4 == 6 || $4 == 7){arrdelay += $15 ; numFlights +=1 }} END{print arrdelay/numFlights}'
I received help on this question from my friend Manoj. The if statements only pull data from certain days, that is Saturday and Sunday

Result:
4.84079

2b. 
Command used:
chiang59@scholar-fe04:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat 2005.csv | awk -F, '{if($4 == 6 || $4 == 7){arrdelay += $16 ; numFlights +=1 }} END{print arrdelay/numFlights}'
The command is the same as 2a, but uses $16 to return departure delay instead of arrival delay

Result:
7.51425

2c.
Command used:
chiang59@scholar-fe04:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{if($4 == 6 || $4 == 7){arrdelay += $15 ; numFlights +=1 }} END{print arrdelay/numFlights}'
This command is similar to 1c, but uses if statements from 2a

Result:
5.30331 

2d.
Command used:
chiang59@scholar-fe04:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{if($4 == 6 || $4 == 7){arrdelay += $16 ; numFlights +=1 }} END{print arrdelay/numFlights}'
This command is also similar to 2c, but uses $16 to find departure delay

Result:
7.55609

3. Consider the June 2017 taxi cab data, which is located in this folder:

/depot/statclass/data/taxi2018

What is the average distance of a taxi cab ride in New York City in June 2017?

Command used:
chiang59@scholar-fe04:/depot/statclass/data/taxi2018 $ cat yellow_tripdata_2017-06.csv | awk -F, '{distance += $5; numTaxis += 1} END{print distance/numTaxis}'
I also received help on this problem from my friend. This command returns the average trip distance of a taxi cab in June 2017

Result:
2.97862
