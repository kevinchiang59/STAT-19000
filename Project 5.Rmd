# TA NOTES
# Great job!
# 9.5/10 (You forgot to omit values <= 80 on your second plot!)

I had to source help again on both of these questions. 
The PDF showing the results is another file called projecct5result.pdf
Number 1: 
```{r}
AirlineDF = read.csv("/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009/2005.csv")
ta = tapply(AirlineDF$Distance, AirlineDF$UniqueCarrier, mean)
ta = sort(ta)
ta
dotchart(as.numeric(ta), main = "Average distance of each Airline in 2005; ")
```
The function above plots and sorts the airline rides, and orders it by the average distance on the dotplot.

Number 2
```{r}
taxiDF = read.csv("/depot/statclass/data/taxi2018/yellow_tripdata_2017-06.csv")
ra = tapply(taxiDF$total_amount, taxiDF$PULocationID, mean)
ra = sort(ra)
ra
dotchart(as.numeric(ra), main = "Average total amount of Cost of Taxi Ride by Pickup Location ID")
```
The second function serves the same purpose, but uses data from taxi rides.
